This repository contains information and code for the tool competition on test selection for self-driving cars in simulation.

Self-driving cars (SDCs) are equipped with onboard cameras and various sensors have already demonstrated the possibility of autonomous driving in real environments, leading to great interest in various application domains.
However, despite the necessity of systematically testing such complex and automated systems to ensure their safe operation in real-world environments, there has been relatively limited investment in this direction so far.

The SDC Testing Competition organized in the context of the [International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST 2025)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icst-2025) and the [Intl. Workshop on Search-Based and Fuzz Testing (SBFT 2025)](https://sbft25.github.io/tools/) is an initiative designed to inspire and encourage the Software Testing Community to direct their attention toward SDCs as a rapidly emerging and crucial domain.
The competition's focus is on regression testing for test suites executing system tests of SDCs in simulation.
Regression testing involves test selection, prioritization, and minimization.
For the competition, we focus on the first aspect - test selection, as detailed in [Competition Details and Instructions](./COMPETITION.md).
